# Task 1: Defining your Problem and Audience

1. Write a succinct 1-sentence description of the problem
     - Many people nowadays do not have easy/free access to someone they can talk to about their problems.
2. Write 1-2 paragraphs on why this is a problem for your specific user

In today's fast-paced and increasingly digital world, many individuals find themselves isolated and lacking meaningful connections. The cost of professional therapy is often prohibitively expensive, with sessions ranging from $100 to $200 or more, making it inaccessible for a large portion of the population—especially those without adequate insurance or financial resources. As a result, people who are struggling with emotional or mental health issues may have nowhere to turn for support, exacerbating their feelings of helplessness and distress.

This lack of accessible support is particularly concerning given the growing epidemic of loneliness. According to a 2023 report by the U.S. Surgeon General, nearly half of adults in the United States report experiencing loneliness, and this trend is mirrored globally. Social networks have shrunk, and people are more disconnected than ever before, leading to increased risks of depression, anxiety, and even physical health problems. For our specific users, those seeking someone to talk to but unable to afford therapy or find support in their immediate circles—this problem is both urgent and deeply personal, highlighting the need for accessible, free, and empathetic avenues for conversation and connection.

# Task 2: Propose a Solution

1. Write 1-2 paragraphs on your proposed solution.  How will it look and feel to the user?
     The proposed solution is an AI agent that will continuously speak to the user inquiring them about any problems they have been facing and encourage them to take control and better their lives. The agent will remember context about the given user, and use that to enhance future suggestions for changes the user could make in their life. It will look like a regular chatting space for the user, but the idea is to cultivate a warmer/tough love type of agent that can give well-reasoned advice, but also be a great listener, prompting the user to go into the details of what is bothering them.
2. Describe the tools you plan to use in each part of your stack.  Write one sentence on why you made each tooling choice.
     1. LLM
          - OpenAI GPT-4: Chosen for its strong conversational abilities and nuanced understanding, making it perfect for empathetic, context-aware chat.
     2. Embedding Model
          - OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002: Used to turn user messages and knowledge snippets into vectors, enabling smart context recall and similarity search.
     3. Orchestration
          LangGraph: Useful for creating conditional flows in case a user says that the advice given is not helpful.
     4. Vector Database
          - In-memory vector store: Stores and retrieves user context.
     5. Monitoring
          - OpenAI API logging + backend logging: Keeps an eye on system health and usage.
     6. Evaluation
          - Manual review + LangChain/Ragas Evaluation: I will personally be checking the responses to see if they are empathetic and constructive. In addition, LangChain/Ragas will also be used to measure empathy, context recall, etc.
     7. User Interface
          - Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS: Delivers a modern, cozy chat experience that feels like texting a wise friend.

3. Where will you use an agent or agents?  What will you use “agentic reasoning” for in your app?
     The core of the app is a conversational AI agent that interacts directly with users, acting as both a supportive listener and a proactive coach. Agentic reasoning is used to remember the user’s context, ask thoughtful follow-up questions, and suggest personalized actions or advice based on previous conversations. The agent actively guides the conversation, nudges users toward self-reflection, and adapts its approach over time to better support each individual’s journey. This “tough love” agent leverages agentic reasoning to balance empathy with actionable suggestions, making every chat feel both caring and constructive.

# Task 3: Dealing with the Data

1. Describe all of your data sources and external APIs, and describe what you’ll use them for.
      - Document generated by ChatGPT for the top 20 problems that humans face in their lifetime and how to go about dealing with them
      - Tavily API for when the user has a very niche specific problem that requires online research
      - User conversations will be stored in the vector store, to keep up with the user life context.

2. Describe the default chunking strategy that you will use.  Why did you make this decision?
     The default chunking strategy will be to split user conversations and any reference documents into manageable segments of around 500 tokens each, with a small overlap (for example, 50 tokens) between chunks. This approach ensures that each chunk contains enough context for meaningful semantic search and retrieval, while also preventing important information from being lost at chunk boundaries. The decision to use this strategy is based on balancing two needs: keeping chunks small enough for efficient vector search and LLM context windows, but large enough to preserve the flow and nuance of user conversations. Overlapping chunks help maintain continuity, so the agent can recall details even if they fall at the edge of a segment.
3. [Optional] Will you need specific data for any other part of your application?   If so, explain.
